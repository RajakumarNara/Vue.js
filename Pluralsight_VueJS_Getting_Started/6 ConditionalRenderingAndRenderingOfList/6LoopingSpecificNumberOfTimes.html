<!--In some situations, I know that exactly how many number of times to loop.
Ex. Number of pages of search result returned by search.
This information and v-for directive used to create search result page.
In this code snippet, using html unorder list. Notice that v-for directive 
has not placed on <ul> tag though, placed it on <li> list item element, because
that is the element repeated. This template will repeate until pageCount
reached. <li list should match to pageCount. Alias page, represents the current
item that is being iterated on. Page represents the current item iterated on.
It starts with 1, in other programming lang it is 0 zero. 1 not 0zero.
I can iterate over range of integer but cannot iterate over range of floating point number
