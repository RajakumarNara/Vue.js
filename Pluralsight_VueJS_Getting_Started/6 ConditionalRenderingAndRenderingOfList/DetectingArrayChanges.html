<!--Vue has 7 big Mutation functions to change an array as needed.
1. sort
2. Push
3. Pop
4. Reverse
5. shift()
6. unshift()
7. slice()
These fun wrap around standard JS array functions.

sort() -> function puts up elements in an array in order.
By default sort() fun treats value as a string

reverse() -> rearranges an array into the opposite direction.

push() -> Addes items to the end of the array

pop() -> Removes last item from an arry
push and pop helps to work with end of the array.

unshift() -> Add items to the beginning of Array
shift() -> Removes the first item of an Array
