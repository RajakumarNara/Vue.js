<!--Vue provides several directive to empower, conditionaly render during
runtime:
v-if,  v-else, v-show these directive serve unique purposes for that reason
cover these directive in details in this section
v-if v-else directive conditionally render content based on an expression

v-show directive is to show content conditionaly at runtime. It is similar to 
if directive 
This is slightly different because in this case only dispaly css property change.
v-show conditionaly set the CSS display property at runtime. 
If expression on this directive evaluates, the elements display property set to none
When do we use show directive, it always render the element.
Show directive use to show or hided an html block.
